## Glass Cockpit

The Boeing 787 features a "glass cockpit" design, which means it uses large multifunctional screens instead of traditional dials and gauges. These screens make it easier for pilots to see and manage critical flight information in a clear and organized way.

## Head-up Display (HUD)

HUD technology to provide pilots with a clear, intuitive, and unobstructed view of critical flight information. The HUD is a transparent display that projects information directly in the pilotâ€™s line of sight, allowing them to keep their eyes on the outside world while still having access to important flight data.
