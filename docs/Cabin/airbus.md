# Airbus's Cabin Design

## Air Flow

Airbus planes are designed to keep the air in the cabin clean and safe for passengers and crew. They use an Environment Control System (ECS) to manage air quality, temperature, and pressure. Fresh air constantly flows into the cabin from outside, while used air is pushed out every two to three minutes, keeping the air fresh much faster than in classrooms or offices.

Any air that is recirculated goes through HEPA filters, which remove over 99.9% of particles, including bacteria and viruses, making the air safe to breathe. These filters have been used in Airbus planes since 1994 and are very effective in keeping the cabin air clean throughout the flight. [^1]

## Cabin Experience

Airbus was the first to introduce ambient lighting, which uses color and brightness changes to enhance the atmosphere during different phases of the flight. This lighting can even simulate sunrise or sunset to reduce jet lag, helping passengers arrive feeling refreshed and ready.[^1]
