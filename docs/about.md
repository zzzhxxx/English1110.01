# About

## Project Statement

My project covers the technologies employed in modern commercial aircraft and their impact on safety, passengers' experience, environmental sustainability, and every other perspective of aviation. Specifically, the two most relevant aircraft types are considered: Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

The development of my research had to do with studying technical documentation and safety reports related to relevant case studies, such as the recent collision on a runway at Haneda Airport involving an A350. That was an example of how materials, like carbon fiber composites, make fires not spread rapidly, which saves passengers and crew members during an incident. I focus on real-life applications in endeavoring to present findings in a manner that is interesting to both the technical and non-technical audience, showing how advanced engineering contributes to tangible safety outcomes.
I want to help raise the general awareness of the public about aviation safety technologies. To all aviation enthusiasts, flight simulator players, and even people with a fear of flying, I want to give a reassuring perspective: how manufacturers and engineers go all out to ensure safety in the air.

The motivation for this work is to present, through this project, the importance of continuous innovation in aviation. I want to be able to explain, using clear descriptions and depictions, visual aids, and case studies, complex technical concepts in an understandable and effective manner to all the members of my audience. I strongly believe that this showcase will not only educate people about the present state of aviation safety but also the continuous efforts being done toward air travel safety.

## About the Author

A student from Shanghai,China and major in Computer and Information Sciecnce at The Ohio State University.

As an aviation enthusiast with a deep interest in aviation, my research has started with aviation accidents and safety regulations and now comes to the evolution of safety technologies in commercial aircraft, which reflects my long-standing passion for both technology and flight. My fascination with airplanes began in childhood and developed into a more technical curiosity as I encountered advancements in aerospace engineering. Now, as a student at The Ohio State University, I have the chance to have deeper research on my interest and develop it as my research project.
