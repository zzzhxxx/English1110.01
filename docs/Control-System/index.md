# Control System

## What is Control System?

An airplane's control system is like its "steering and brakes." It helps the pilots move and control the airplane. When a pilot pushes or pulls on the control stick, turns the wheel, or presses the pedals, these actions are sent through cables, hydraulics, or electronic signals to move parts of the airplane, like the wings (ailerons), tail (elevators and rudder), or even the flaps.
